{"name":"Wafelijzer","tagline":"","body":"Wafelijzer\r\n==========\r\n\r\n> Brought to you by [Belgian Man Records](http://belgianman.com)\r\n\r\nWafelijzer is web software you can use to make a beautiful and easy-to-run website for your record label or collective.\r\n\r\nYou can get it up and running in 5 minutes or less, and add artists, albums, news, videos, or even sell merch using the simple online interface.\r\n\r\nWafelijzer looks fantastic out-of-the-box, but it's also totally customizable. Theme it up to your heart's content. \r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nWafelijzer's development is guided by 3 principles:\r\n\r\n1.\t**Keep it easy:** You don't need any technical, web development, or coding experience to use Wafelijzer. A label shouldn't need a 'Web Dude,' artists can add easily add their own content.\r\n\r\n2.\t**Make it free:** Wafelijzer is designed to run on a free [Heroku](http://heroku.com) server.\r\n\r\n3.\t**Stay lazy:** You already use services like bandcamp, soundcloud, vimeo, and youtube. Wafelijzer automatically pulls your content from these services so you don't have to type the same shit over and over.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nThere's a demo running at [http://wafelijzer-demo.herokuapp.com/](http://wafelijzer-demo.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\nYou can log into the [admin page](http://wafelijzer-demo.herokuapp.com/admin) with the username `admin@example.com` and the password `password`.\r\n\r\n## 5-Minute Install\r\n\r\nTo set up Wafelijzer you'll need a Mac. Or any other computer, provided it has [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed, and a working `ruby` environment. \r\n\r\nFirst off, you'll need a free [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account and to install the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).\r\n\r\nWe're gonna have to use the Terminal real quick, but only just this once. And it's easy, I swear. On a Mac, you'll find it in the `Utilities` folder within your `Applications` folder. \r\n\r\nFind the folder on your computer where you'd like to keep Wafelijzer, open the Terminal, and get your copy-and-paste fingers ready.\r\n\r\nType `cd ` (with a space after), drag the folder icon right onto the Terminal window, and press enter.\r\n\r\nOne by one, copy-and-paste the following lines into the Terminal, pressing enter after each.\r\n\r\n\tgit clone https://github.com/belgianman/wafelijzer.git\r\n\theroku create\r\n\tgit push heroku master\r\n\theroku run rake sq:migrate:up\r\n\theroku restart\r\n\theroku open\r\n\r\nBoom! Safari (or Chrome, or some browser) just opened and you can see a really empty-lookin' website. Add `/bootstrap` to the URL in your browser's location bar to add some content and set up your account.\r\n\r\n### You're done!\r\n\r\nYou should click the \"Admin Page\" link on the bottom right and log in. Your username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`. Change them.\r\n\r\n## Customizing Wafelijzer\r\n\r\n### Settings\r\n\r\nYou can change your settings by visiting the `/admin` page and clicking the `Settings` tab. Click `new` to add a setting, or click the little pencil icon on the right of each entry to change its value.\r\n\r\nTitle \t\t\t\t\t| Value\r\n------------------------|-----------------------------------\r\nlabel_name\t\t\t\t| eg \"Belgian Man Records\"\r\nlogo\t\t\t\t\t| A url for your label's logo. It'll show up at the top right side of every page.\r\ntheme \t\t\t\t\t| If you've added a theme, you can enter its title here.\r\ngoogle_analytics_code\t| If you use google analytics, you can enter your code here. It looks something like `UA-22952798-15`.\r\nstore_url\t\t\t\t| If you already have a store, you can enter the url here and a link will be added in the navigation bar.\r\nfacebook\t\t\t\t| If you have a facebook page, enter the shortname here (whatever comes after `http://www.facebook.com/`) and a link will be added in the navigation bar.\r\nfrontpage_item_count\t| This is the number of recent things that show up on your front page. Default is 10. \r\nsoundcloud_client_id\t| To pull information off of soundcloud, you'll need a [soundcloud_client_id](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new)\r\nsoundcloud_name\t\t\t| If your label has a soundcloud, enter it here. The most recent favorite will be embedded on your front page.\r\ntypekit\t\t\t\t\t| If your theme uses [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) for custom fonts, enter your kit ID here.\r\nstripe_secret_key\t\t| to sell merch and collect money, you'll need a [Stripe](http://stripe.com) account. You'll get a secret and publishable key from them.\r\nstripe_publishable_key\t| \r\n\r\n### Texts\r\n\r\nThis is where you edit the blurb that shows up on your site's front page, and the text that goes into your site's footer.\r\n\r\n### Themes\r\n\r\nA theme is some custom CSS and/or Javascript that gets added to every page of your site. \r\n\r\n### Artists\r\n\r\nArtists can be either people, or bands (which can have multiple artists in them).\r\n\r\n### Albums\r\n\r\nAlbum info (title, about, credits, ...) is all pulled from Bandcamp, so you only need to enter an album's Bandcamp url to add it.\r\n\r\n### Blogs\r\n\r\nThis is for stuff like events, press, news, or what have you. They can be affiliated with a particular artist, so they show up on that artist's page, or not, so they show up on just the home page.\r\n\r\n### Accounts\r\n\r\nIf you'd like, you can give all your artists their own accounts. Or you can share. Whatever. Once someone has an account, they can edit stuff and add willy-nilly, so if you're worried the password might get out it might make sense to use multiple accounts so you can delete them easily if the need ever arrises.\r\n\r\n### Videos\r\n\r\nVideos can be pulled from Youtube or Vimeo.\r\n\r\n### Merches\r\n\r\nAdd merch here. If you add sign up for a [Square](http://square.com) account and set the `square_publishable_key` and `square_private_key` settings, you can take credit cards right from your website.\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nIf you have any issues with Wafelijzer, either [send me an email](mailto:a@monks.co) or create an issue [on github](https://github.com/belgianman/wafelijzer/issues).","google":"UA-22952798-15","note":"Don't delete this file!
