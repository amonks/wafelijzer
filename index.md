# Wafelijzer

<p class="lead">
Wafelijzer is web software you can use to make a beautiful and easy-to-run website for your record label or collective.
</p>

You can get it up and running in 5 minutes or less, and add artists, albums, news, videos, or even sell merch using the simple online interface.

Wafelijzer looks fantastic out-of-the-box, but it's also totally customizable. Theme it up to your heart's content.

## Goals

Wafelijzer's development is guided by 3 principles:

1.  **Keep it easy:** You don't need any technical, web development, or coding experience to use Wafelijzer. A label shouldn't need a 'Web Dude:' artists can add easily add their own content.

2.  **Make it free:** Wafelijzer is designed to run on a free [Heroku](http://heroku.com) server.

3.  **Stay lazy:** You already use services like [BandCamp](https://bandcamp.com/), [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). Wafelijzer automatically pulls your content from these services so you don't have to type the same shit over and over.
