# # This is our blog controller

# We'll use this file to handle routing for blogs.

# blogs could be press, news, events, or anything else.
# Each distinct `blog.type` creates a link up in the navbar to an index of all blogs of that type, eg `press`.

  # We'll map it to `/news/:type` because `/blogs/events` or `blogs/press` sounds weird.
