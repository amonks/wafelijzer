It's super easy to update to a new version of Wafelijzer.

First, find the folder on your computer where you downloaded Wafelijzer.

Open up the Terminal, type `cd` (with a space after), drag the wafelijzer folder right onto the Terminal window, and press enter.

One by one, copy-and-paste the following two lines into the Terminal, pressing enter after each.

	git pull origin master
	git push heroku master

### You're done!
