You can change your settings by visiting the `/admin` page and clicking the `Settings` tab. Click `new` to add a setting, or click the little pencil icon on the right of each entry to change its value.

### Texts

This is where you edit the blurb that shows up on your site's front page, and the text that goes into your site's footer.

### Themes

A theme is some custom CSS and/or Javascript that gets added to every page of your site.

### Artists

Artists can be either people, or bands (which can have multiple artists in them).

### Albums

Album info (title, about, credits, ...) is all pulled from Bandcamp, so you only need to enter an album's Bandcamp url to add it.

### Blogs

This is for stuff like events, press, news, or what have you. They can be affiliated with a particular artist, so they show up on that artist's page, or not, so they show up on just the home page.

If you give a blog a `type` (eg 'press'), Wafelijzer will round up all the blogs of that type and make a link for them at the top of every page.

### Accounts

If you'd like, you can give all your artists their own accounts. Or you can share. Whatever. Once someone has an account, they can edit stuff and add willy-nilly, so if you're worried the password might get out it might make sense to use multiple accounts so you can delete them easily if the need ever arrises.

### Videos

Videos can be pulled from Youtube or Vimeo.

### Merches

Add merch here. If you add sign up for a [Square](http://square.com) account and set the `square_publishable_key` and `square_private_key` settings, you can take credit cards right from your website.
