You can easily sell merch (and take credit cards) with Wafelijzer.

First, you'll need an account with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), the payment processor we use.

Once you're all signed up, they'll give you two long passwords: a publishable key, and a secret key.

[Add a setting](/customization) for each of those keys: they should be called `stripe_publishable_key` and `stripe_secret_key`
